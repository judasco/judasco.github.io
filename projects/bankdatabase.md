summary: "Bank Record Management System is a database that allows users to manage customer records by adding new accounts, searching for existing customers by account number, viewing all records, and deleting accounts, with all data automatically saved to a file. (Note: The program itself does not have authentication/login - anyone who runs it can access all function. This was a program from a class, ICS212.)"
