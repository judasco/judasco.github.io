*Difficulty: a thing that is hard to accomplish, deal with, or understand.*

I was never really sure of what I wanted to be growing up. I knew what I enjoyed, I knew my strengths and weaknesses, and just like everyone in this world, I had desires of being successful and longed to be content with my life. I must admit, I am not your typical "computer science major" where I love video games, computers, and puzzles. In my free time, I urge to be away from any technology. I enjoy being out, meeting people, having a community, and being far away from any device and technology. Now you may be wondering, why the heck am I pursuing computer science?
The answer revealed itself to me gradually. I realized that the most impactful technology isn't the kind that keeps people glued to screens—it's the kind that solves real problems and brings people together. I saw how apps could organize community events, how platforms could connect people with shared interests, and how software could make services more accessible to those who needed them most. My interest in computer science doesn't stem from a love of technology for technology's sake, but from recognizing it as a powerful tool to serve the communities and people I care about. I chose this field because I wanted to be part of creating solutions that enhance human connection rather than replace it, and because I saw an opportunity to bring a different perspective to an industry that desperately needs voices from outside the traditional tech bubble.
What I bring to software engineering is perhaps unconventional, but I believe it's valuable. My strength lies in understanding people—what they need, how they interact, and what makes experiences meaningful to them. This translates into a natural inclination toward user-centered design and accessible technology. I'm drawn to areas like human-computer interaction, social computing, and designing systems that prioritize usability and inclusivity. While I may not have grown up tinkering with computers, I've spent years understanding group dynamics, communication, and what makes communities thrive. These soft skills, combined with the technical knowledge I'm building, position me to create technology that actually serves its users rather than confusing or overwhelming them.
Looking toward the future, I hope to develop a robust technical foundation while maintaining my human-centered approach. I want to master full-stack development, learn about scalable system design, and understand the principles that make software both powerful and maintainable. Beyond the technical skills, I'm eager to explore how technology intersects with social impact—whether that's through building accessible applications, contributing to open-source projects that serve underrepresented communities, or working on products that genuinely improve quality of life. My goal isn't just to become a skilled software engineer, but to become one who builds with empathy, purpose, and an awareness of technology's broader impact on society. I may have arrived at computer science through an unconventional path, but I'm confident that this perspective will help me create technology that truly matters.

One of my friends asked the question earlier last week -- why is it so hard to be an officer for the student branch? Why is so hard compared to working at my on-campus job? This question came after he struggled a little with bookkeeping for the student organization.

Now I gave him the standard answer - being an officer of an organization requires that you manage your time between school and work. There isn't anyone telling you what to do. It's the answer any good mentor would give, and is mostly true.

But the more I though about it, the more I wondered to myself...damn that's a really great question; it's one that deserves some more thought. Most people I think stop at the answer I gave previously - he obviously isn't managing his time properly.

Here's what I think: the difficult things will always be difficult.

## In the context of programming

In the context of programming, this has always been true. The difficult problems have always been different, although changes in technology can change the landscape quite a bit. "Business" type applications are the things that come to mind for me. Those types of applications are usually coupled in some way with people ... and people are awfully hard to deal with!

Consider that one of the most popular content management systems is also considered the most horrible - Wordpress. But really, is there anything that fills that need? If it was so easy in the first place, where is the solution? Where's the magic CMS that is designed well enough that everyone hops on the boat to use it?

Some things are just difficult - building applications that humans use is hard, and will probably be hard for at least the near future.

## In the context of engineering

Ever hear people ragging on engineering companies for delivering late and way over budget? Well, some engineering jobs are really difficult, especially if the requirements and funding are undulating underneath you. Because of the nature of the problem, sometimes engineering firms require large amounts of engineers and workers, inviting further problems and delays.

The Honolulu Rail project at home has become this sort of poster child of failure, budget overrun and overall incompetence in Hawaii. Well, working though regulatory boards and fiscal procedures in Hawaii seems like it's a mind bogglingly difficult job to do. Granted, there might be some fishy stuff going on, but I refuse to believe that everyone is involved for nefarious reasons.

The problem of creating an unprecedented public transportation backbone on an island is difficult! I'm not sure we would have done it right, even if the best people were involved.

## In the context of relationships

So in the end, we realize that all engineering and programming is there for a reason - to serve human needs. Maybe that's why those things are difficult, because they both involve humans and are for humans.

Relationships, regardless if they're romantic or not take work. Humans are fickle creatures and relationships can come and go with the wind. To properly maintain something over time requires work. Family takes work. Marriage takes work. We live to figure out what works and what doesn't and hope that as we move forward we're improving.

Relationships have always been difficult, and by nature will continue to be so.

## Okay!

So back to the original premise; why is being one of the club officers so difficult?

And the final answer - it's supposed to be difficult, and it's supposed to challenge you, just like everything else that humans do that is difficult: programming, engineering, engaging in relationships, pondering the universe, etc.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.
